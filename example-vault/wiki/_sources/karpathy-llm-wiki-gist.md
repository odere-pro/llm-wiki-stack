# Karpathy LLM Wiki Gist

## Metadata

- **Author:** Andrej Karpathy
- **Publisher:** GitHub Gist
- **Published:** 2026-02-01

## Summary

Karpathy's pattern for LLM-maintained personal wikis. Human curates sources in `raw/`; LLM derives a structured `wiki/` folder organized by topic. The pattern rests on two invariants — provenance is structural (every wiki page cites a source) and the wiki is derived rather than authoritative (contradictions are recorded as typed relationships, not silent overwrites).

## Key Claims

- Sources in `raw/` are immutable.
- Wiki pages are organized by topic, not by source.
- Every wiki page must cite at least one source.
- Contradictions between sources are recorded as typed relationships; the human resolves them.
